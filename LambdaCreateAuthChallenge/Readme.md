# To trigger  Create Auth Challange lambda-tools-defaults


## AWS Lambda Function Project

This starter project consists of:
* Function.cs - class file containing a class with a single function handler method
* aws-lambda-tools-defaults.json - default argument settings for use with Visual Studio and command line deployment tools for AWS

You may also have a test project depending on the options selected.

The generated function handler is a simple method accepting a string argument that returns the uppercase equivalent of the input string. Replace the body of this method, and parameters, to suit your needs.
